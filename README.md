Problem Statement 2
The Grid-X
Challenge: In any community massive amounts of resources go underutilized: unused
high-speed bandwidth, idle GPU/CPU cycles on gaming laptops. Your goal is to build Grid-X, a
decentralised resource mesh where users can trade assets securely.
Infrastructure: use Docker to create a sandboxed environment for students who want to rent
their CPU/GPU cycles, ensuring the guest user cannot access the host’s private files
